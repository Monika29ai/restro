        <h1>Ambiance: 5/5</h1>

            From the moment you step inside, you'll be enveloped in a warm and inviting atmosphere. The décor is elegant yet cozy, with dim lighting, comfortable seating, and soft background music that sets the tone for a relaxing evening.<br>

            The service at Bistro Bliss is top-notch. The staff is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. Our server, Rachel, was exceptional, making excellent recommendations and ensuring that our glasses were always full.<br>
            
           <h1>Food: 5/5</h1>
            
            The real star of the show is the food. Bistro Bliss offers a diverse menu that blends classic flavors with modern twists. We started with the Pan-Seared Scallops, which were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths. For our main course, we opted for the Grilled Filet Mignon and the Pan-Roasted Chicken, both of which were tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Be sure to save room for dessert – the Crème Brûlée is a must-try!<br>
            <h1>Value: 5/5</h1>
